## TODO

- [x] Add support for showing and managing server lives when global_lives is True
- [ ] Add command for admins to update a player's life count
- [x] Add announcements for when a player is eliminated, or the global life count changes - I made it so all deaths will announce the updated life count.
- [x] Update `\howmanylives` to be `\lives`
- [ ] Remove hard-coded world name from config.yml
- [x] Actually test this to see if it even works (working so far!)
